# Machine Learning Projects
## Projects I'm going to create on my journey towards ML.

## Tools used
* Google Colab
* Pytorch
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

I will only be using publicly available data to train the models.

## Projects in the repo
1. Iris detection
  * Takes in the arguments like length and width of sepals and petals and gives out an output as one of three iris flower varieties.
  * Data used to train the model - `https://gist.github.com/netj/8836201`

2. House Prices
  * Takes in the various usefule arguments from the data set like living-area, np. of bedrooms, no. of bathrooms etc and outputs the estimated price.
